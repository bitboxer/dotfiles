# Bodo Tasche Dot Files #

This is my dotfiles with all the things I need for
my day to day work. I am developing inside of a
vagrant box that is provisioned via ansible. Start
it via `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`. From time to time
I will do a `vagrant destroy` to have a clean machine.

This is a work in progress, I will explain my setup in
more details in the future.

# TODO

- [ ] Document this
- [ ] Figure out how to deal with code, NFS mount is not ideal
- [ ] Check out old `packages.yml` and figure out what is needed
- [ ] Remove stuff from host mac
