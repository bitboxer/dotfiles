# Bodo Tasche Dot Files #

This is my dotfiles with all the things I need for
my day to day work. I am developing inside of a
vagrant box that is provisioned via ansible. Start
it via `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`. From time to time
I will do a `vagrant destroy` to have a clean machine.

This is a work in progress, I will explain my setup in
more details in the future.
